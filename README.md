## Kaggle API setup

- The repository previously contained a Kaggle API key; that key has been removed for security.
- Create a `kaggle.json` in the repo root or place it in `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json` with this structure:

```json
{
	"username": "YOUR_USERNAME",
	"key": "YOUR_KEY"
}
```

- A placeholder example file is available as `kaggle.example.json`.
- `kaggle.json` is now listed in `.gitignore` to avoid accidentally committing secrets.
